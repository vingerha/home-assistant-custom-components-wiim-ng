This is a fork of https://github.com/m-stefanski/home-assistant-custom-components-wiim-ng, created to introduce some API features.

This component allows you to integrate control of WiiM Mini, Pro, Pro Plus and Amp devices into your [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io) smart home system. Originally developed for LinkPlay devices by @nicjo814, @limych and @nagyrobi, later forked by @onlyoneme.

## Installation
* Copy all files in `custom_components/wiim_custom_ng` to your `<config directory>/custom_components/wiim_custom_ng/` directory.
* Restart Home-Assistant.
* In Settings > Devices, add integration for WiiM and fill in the settings described below

### Settings

**host:**  
  *(string)* *(Required)* The IP address of the WiiM unit. Make sure it gets the same IP via static lease.

**name:**  
  *(string)* *(Required)* Name that Home Assistant will generate the `entity_id` based on. It is also the base of the friendly name seen in the dashboard, but will be overriden by the device name set in the smartphone WiiM app.

**uuid:**  
  *(string)* *(Optional)* Hardware UUID of the player. Can be read out from the attibutes of the entity. Set it manually to that value to handle double-added entity cases when Home Assistant starts up without the WiiM device being on the network at that moment.
  
**volume_step:**  
  *(integer)* *(Optional)* Step size in percent to change volume when calling `volume_up` or `volume_down` service against the media player. Defaults to `5`, can be a number between `1` and `25`.
